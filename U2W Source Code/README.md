# 🧪 U2W: Untangle to Weave Disjoint Assertion Tangles in Unit Tests

**U2W** is a program analysis-based tool that automatically detects and refactors a novel test-code smell called **Disjoint Assertion Tangles (DAT)** — where a single test method verifies multiple logically unrelated behaviors.
Note: Main file is `Untangle2Weave.java`
---

## What It Does

- **Detects** test methods exhibiting Disjoint Assertion Tangles (DAT), which hinder test readability, maintainability, and fault isolation.
- **Refactors** such tests into smaller, focused test methods to improve structure and clarity.
- **Recognizes and leverages** duplication by identifying structurally similar tests.
- **Generates parameterized unit tests (PUTs)** to reduce redundancy and enable scalable, extensible test design.

---

## Backed by Research

U2W was evaluated on **42,334 tests across 49 open-source projects**, revealing:
- **DAT smell in 95.9%** of subject projects,
- Over **3,638 smelly tests refactored**,
- **1,713 PUTs generated**, with an average of **5.85** value sets per test,
- **36.33% average reduction** in executable test-code lines.

To validate its effectiveness:
- A **user study with 34 software engineers and 15 students** confirmed the practical utility of U2W,
- **19 pull requests** were submitted based on the tool's refactorings, with **15 accepted** by project maintainers.

These results demonstrate that U2W can significantly improve test-suite quality with minimal developer intervention.

## To Run This Tool

U2W can be run locally or integrated into your CI/CD pipeline. Follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **Java 11 or higher**: Ensure you have the JDK installed and set up on your system
- Clone this repository to your local machine

### Input and Output
- **INPUT**: Path to Java repository/repositories
- **OUTPUT**: Creates new test files as recommendations in the same directory as the input files
- **2 files generated per input**:
    1. Separated test file
    2. Parameterized test file (if structurally similar tests are found)

### Running Modes

U2W supports the following execution modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `detectin` | Detect DATs (Duplicate and Almost-duplicate Tests) in a single file |
| `detect` | Detect DATs in a single repository |
| `allrepo` | Detect DATs in multiple repositories |
| `fixInRepo` | Detect and fix DATs in a single repository with XLSX report generation |
| `fixInAllRepoWithXLSXReport` | Detect and fix DATs in multiple repositories with XLSX report generation |

### Configuration

For fix modes with XLSX report generation, you can specify the output location:
- Navigate to `Untangle2Weave.java` in the main method
- Update the `outputFilePath` variable with your desired output directory

### Usage

To run U2W, provide the input path followed by one of the execution modes:

```bash
# Detect in Single repository
java -jar Untangle2Weave.jar /path/to/java/repo detect

# Detect in Multiple repositories (comma-separated)
java -jar Untangle2Weave.jar /path/to/repo1,/path/to/repo2,/path/to/repo3 allrepo

# Fix in single repo with report generation
java -jar Untangle2Weave.jar /path/to/java/repo fixInRepo

# Fix in multiple repo with report generation
java -jar Untangle2Weave.jar /path/to/java/repo,/path/to/repo2 fixInAllRepoWithXLSXReport
```

The LLM Enhancement module has been build to be run as a separate step after the refactoring step. It can be run by running the java file refactor2refresh.TestEnhancer.java and providing the path to the refactored test file as an argument.

##### Note
The logs / code might refer to DAT smell as Assertion Pasta, since it was the old name for the same smell.
